# EC2 Connect

A modern Terminal User Interface (TUI) for managing AWS EC2 instances — list, search, SSH, SCP, and scan servers across all regions.

## Quick Install

**Linux / macOS:**

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zb-ss/ec2-ssh/master/install.sh | bash
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zb-ss/ec2-ssh/master/install.ps1 | iex
```

**Or install directly via pipx / pip:**

```bash
pipx install ec2-tui
```

**Manual install from source:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zb-ss/ec2-ssh.git
cd ec2-ssh
pipx install .
```

## Features

- **Interactive TUI** with mouse and keyboard support powered by [Textual](https://textual.textualize.io/)
- **List and search** EC2 instances across all AWS regions
- **SSH into instances** — launches in new terminal window with auto-detected emulator
- **Run remote commands** via overlay panel with real-time streaming output, persistent history, and saved command favorites
- **Browse remote file systems** — interactive file tree navigation
- **SCP file transfer** — upload/download files and directories
- **Keyword-based server scanning** — search file contents across instances
- **Bastion host / jump server support** via ProxyJump or ProxyCommand
- **SSH key management** with auto-discovery and per-instance configuration
- **Instance caching** with stale-while-revalidate for fast startup
- **Fully configurable** — all settings in `~/.ec2-ssh/config.json`

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- AWS CLI configured (`~/.aws/credentials` and `~/.aws/config`)
- SSH client (standard on Linux/macOS, OpenSSH on Windows)
- `pipx` for isolated installation (recommended)

Your AWS credentials need `ec2:DescribeInstances` and `ec2:DescribeRegions` permissions.

## Usage

```bash
ec2-ssh           # Launch the TUI
ec2-ssh --debug   # Launch with debug logging to stderr
```

### Keyboard Shortcuts

| Context | Key | Action |
|---------|-----|--------|
| Global | `Q` | Quit |
| Global | `?` | Help screen |
| Global | `Escape` | Go back / close |
| Instance List | `/` | Focus search |
| Instance List | `R` | Force-refresh from AWS |
| Instance List | `S` | SSH to selected instance |
| Instance List | `B` | Browse remote files |
| Instance List | `C` | Run command overlay |
| Instance List | `T` | SCP transfer |
| Command Overlay | `Ctrl+C` | Stop running command |
| Command Overlay | `Ctrl+R` | Command picker (saved + recent) |
| Command Overlay | `Ctrl+S` | Save command to favorites |
| Command Overlay | `Up/Down` | Command history |

### What You Can Do

1. **List Instances** — View all EC2 instances with search/filter
2. **Search** — Filter instances by name, type, region, or state; search scan results
3. **Manage SSH Keys** — Configure default and per-instance SSH keys
4. **Scan Servers** — Run keyword scans across running instances
5. **Settings** — Configure connection profiles, scan rules, preferences

When you select a server: browse files, run commands, SSH connect, SCP transfer, or view scan results. Command history persists across sessions — use `Ctrl+R` to search history and saved commands, `Ctrl+S` to save favorites.

### Instance Caching

| Scenario | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| First launch (no cache) | Fetches from AWS with progress indicator |
| Restart within TTL (default 1h) | Instant load from cache |
| Restart after TTL | Shows stale data immediately, refreshes in background |
| Press `R` | Force-refresh from AWS |

### Configuration

All configuration lives in `~/.ec2-ssh/config.json`, created automatically on first run.

See [Configuration Guide](docs/configuration.md) for the full reference including connection profiles, scan rules, and match conditions.

## Development

```bash
# Run directly (primary dev workflow)
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m ec2_ssh.main

# Run with debug logging
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m ec2_ssh.main --debug

# Install editable
pip install -e .

# Update pipx installation after changes
pipx install . --force
```

```bash
# Run tests
pip install -e ".[test]"
pytest
```

See [Architecture](docs/architecture.md) for codebase structure and design patterns.

## Troubleshooting

See [Troubleshooting Guide](docs/troubleshooting.md) for help with SSH connections, bastion hosts, key management, and AWS credentials.

## Logging

Logs are always written to `~/.ec2-ssh/logs/ec2_ssh.log`. Use `--debug` for verbose stderr output.

When SSH fails, the terminal window stays open showing the error and exit code.
